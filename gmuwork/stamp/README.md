# STAMP Implementation
Python implementation of matrix profile algorithms (http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html).
Early implementation of the algorithm STAMP. 
```
from STAMP import STAMP
STAMP(time_seriesA,window_size,time_seriesB or None)
```
Mainly created from the first STAMP paper.
